# Test-Driven Design Workshop [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](./README-EN.md)[ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·](./README.md)[ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸](./README-ES.md)[ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·](./README-FR.md)

## Project Context / Motivation

In many software development projects there's a knowledge lack of practical about
TDD development.

## Repository Target

This workshop was designed in a way to learn and practice TDD was posible in any
programming language that fits with TDD use, with their caracterisctis and tools,
with focus in thinking way in the code development process in production
environments, independent of their context (backend, frontend, mobile, etc),
dismistifying it is only possible development TDD in backend with specific
tools and supporting the continuous integration and delivery process of clean code,
at least maintanable and with quality.

## DOJO - Practical Exercise

There is the DOJO practice, a process in group which test are done and the code
implementation fits the test written before, the developer is rotated between
then to exercise the team code development and the coding pairing.

## I want to use the repository, Can I

Feel free to use this repository content

## There isn't the programming language I use with my team and project

This repository is open to be forked and contribuitions for us can have a test
base using TDD and the pairing practice in vast contexts, if it is possible
and you want to contribute, request a Merge Request to aggregate new programming
language, tecnologies and tools to contribute to people whom can improve the
eficient in the quality software delivery.
